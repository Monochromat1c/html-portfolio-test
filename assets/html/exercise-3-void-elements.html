                        William Blake (28 November 1757 â€“ 12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker.
                        Largely unrecognised
                        during his life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and
                        visual art of the
                        Romantic
                        Age. What he called his "prophetic works" were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form
                        "what is in
                        proportion
                        to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language".[2] His visual artistry led
                        21st-century critic
                        Jonathan Jones to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced".[3]
                        In 2002, Blake was
                        placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[4] While he lived in London
                        his entire life,
                        except
                        for three years spent in Felpham,[5] he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of
                        works, which embraced
                        the
                        imagination as "the body of God"[6] or "human existence itself".[7]

                    <p class="margin-bottom-1">
                        Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he is held in
                        high regard by later
                        critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical
                        undercurrents within his work.
                        His
                        paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as
                        "Pre-Romantic".[8] In fact, he
                        has
                        been said to be "a key early proponent of both Romanticism and Nationalism".[9] A committed
                        Christian who was
                        hostile to
                        the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced
                        by the ideals and
                        ambitions of the French and American revolutions.[10][11] Though later he rejected many of these
                        political beliefs,
                        he
                        maintained an amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also
                        influenced by thinkers such
                        as
                        Emanuel Swedenborg.[12] Despite these known influences, the singularity of Blake's work makes
                        him difficult to
                        classify.
                        The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti characterised him as a "glorious
                        luminary",[13] and "a man not
                        forestalled by predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by known
                        or readily
                        surmisable
                        successors".[14]
